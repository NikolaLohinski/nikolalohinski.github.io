* The `development` branch holds the definition of the `antora` UI to be used to generate the resume, and the `antora` playbook file describing the content ;
* Any `<Language>` branch (for example `Fran√ßais` or `English`) holds the `.adoc` documents with the actual content, and is referenced in the `development` playbook file to be bundled and deployed.
